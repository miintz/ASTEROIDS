METAL ASTEROIDS known bugs

* The collisions are not perfect, sometimes asteroids stick within each other when moving fast,
  or skip collision entirely. 
* You currently can cheat by moving the ship in the corner, the asteroids can't hit you. 
  Really though, don't be THAT guy... 
* Text placement is not optimal, should be done taking characters number in account.
* There is a fair bit of RNG involved with the placement of asteroids, so the difficulty levels
  can be a bit disjointed.
* I need to take a look again at the various timers used, it works but it's very very ugly.
* Collision with the player is a bit weird
* Sometimes the health goes below zero making it impossible to lose
