METAL ASTEROIDS is a game developed by Maarten van Hees, s1602721, for the course Introduction to Programming
of the fantastic Media Technology MSc program from Leiden University, NL. 

Gameplay information: Use your mouse (or touchpad if you fancy a challenge) to dodge the odd projectiles. If you don't, well,
you lose. Each game you are assigned a special power, activate by clicking. The asteroids get a random mutation which will affect their 
behaviour somewhat. Score high for interesting score ratings! You start off with a brief invincibility to account for the placement of 
the asteroids. Bad programming on my part, sorry. You will see two numbers next to your ship, the left number is your remaining health,
the right number is your power cooldown. If it is 0 you can use it again. Also, music from the band Manowar is featured, because Eric Adams 
is a BAMF.

No further points to be made! Or maybe one. If you don't like shouty, screamy or otherwise grumbly vocals, don't play ARNIE MODE! (The box below)
if you do, well by all means, do play ARNIE MODE!

Additional information about the game: this game is very much a tongue-in-cheek ode to the whole metal scene. I love metal,
i think its an envigorating genre, but it is full of funny and ridiculous stuff. From the funny shit from the 80s to the band Immortal, there's
plenty to see and marvel about. But apart from that it is an amazing genre of music, the most amazing genre of music if you ask me. 
Theres something for everyone. Do you like slow, lumbering, atmospheric stuff? Check. Do you want some epic Death Growls and amazing riffs? Check!
You into Viking culture and Norse mythology? Check! Subtle stuff with mathematical structures? Yup, even that. There's even some stuff with 10-string 
guitars knocking about the place somewhere. Again: something for everyone in the METAL scene. By the way, if you see METAL capitalized, channel 
your inner Eric Adams and say it as he would say it. I promise you, you will enjoy it.
